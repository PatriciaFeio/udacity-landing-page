# Introduction

This is the second mandatory project for the Front End Developer Nanodegree Program sponsored by the Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster Scholarship Program.

The aim of this project is to build a multi-section landing page where the user can navigate through each section using the navigation bar on the top.

# Project Description

This project was developed under the JavaScript & The DOM part of the Front End Developer Nanodegree. The purpose was to dynamically add content to the navigation menu and to improve the user experience differentiating in some way the section actively being viewed. Also, the item clicked on the navigation bar should scroll the user to the appropriate section, instead of giving the default jump.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
